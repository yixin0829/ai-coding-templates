description: Update AGENTS.md documentation to align with the latest source code
---

1. **Synchronize with the remote repository**
   Ensure your local copy is up‑to‑date (e.g., `git fetch` or your preferred pull operation).

2. **Review what differs from the remote**
   - Identify local‑only commits and any uncommitted edits.
   - Inspect the diffs to understand added/removed lines and affected files.

3. **Plan the documentation changes**
   - Carefully read the current `AGENTS.md` file in the project root.
   - Combine this with the diff information from step 2 to determine what needs updating.
   - Draft a concise plan that addresses two objectives:
     1. **Reflect the latest code changes** – decide where in the existing sections new content should go.
     2. **Remove or revise outdated information** – identify deprecated examples, obsolete parameters, or broken links and outline how to correct them.

4. **Update existing by adding new content and clean up outdated documentation**
   a. Open `AGENTS.md`.
   b. Update the documentation as per the plan from step 3.
   c. Clean up outdated documentation to align with source code as per the plan from step 3.
