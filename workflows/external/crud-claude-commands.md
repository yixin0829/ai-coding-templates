## Command Synchronization

After any CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE operation:

1. **Agent-guides repository reference**:
   - Repository: `https://github.com/tokenbender/agent-guides`
   - Commands directory: `/claude-commands/`
   - Scripts directory: `/scripts/`

2. **Sync instructions**:
   - Inform user to manually sync changes to the agent-guides repository
   - Provide the command content for easy copy/paste
   - Suggest creating a PR if appropriate

3. **Reference examples**:
   - View existing commands: https://github.com/tokenbender/agent-guides/tree/main/claude-commands
   - Extract session script: https://github.com/tokenbender/agent-guides/blob/main/scripts/extract-claude-session.py
   - Repository README: https://github.com/tokenbender/agent-guides/blob/main/README.md

## Error Handling

- **Command not found**: Suggest similar commands using fuzzy matching
- **Invalid operation**: Show valid operations (create, read, update, delete, list)
- **Permission errors**: Inform user about file access issues
- **Git errors**: Report but don't fail the primary operation

## Success Criteria

- Command operations complete successfully
- Files are properly formatted and functional
- Changes are synchronized to agent-guides if available
- User receives clear confirmation of actions taken
- Git commits are descriptive and accurate

## Examples of Generated Commands

When creating commands, consider these patterns:

1. **Analysis commands**: Like analyze-function, multi-mind
2. **Workflow commands**: Like page, search-prompts  
3. **Automation commands**: Git operations, testing, deployment
4. **Documentation commands**: Generate docs, update READMEs

Ensure generated commands are:
- Reusable across projects
- Well-documented with examples
- Follow established patterns
- Include error handling
- Provide clear output
