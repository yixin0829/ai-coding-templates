## Example Analysis

**Usage**: `/project:analyze-function train.py:detect_words_gpu`

### **Context & Purpose**
This function is part of the `CurriculumManager` class in a sophisticated GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) training system. It's designed to efficiently detect and count words of different lengths in character-level sequences **entirely on GPU** to support curriculum learning stages that reward proper word formation.

### **Line-by-Line Analysis**

**Line 1326: Function Signature**
```python
def detect_words_gpu(self, sequences: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
```
- **What**: Defines a method taking character index sequences and returning word counts
- **Why**: The `_gpu` suffix indicates this is optimized for GPU execution, crucial since this runs in the training loop where CPU-GPU transfers would be catastrophic for performance
- **Context**: Part of curriculum learning where later stages reward proper word formation

**Line 1328: Shape Extraction**
```python
B, T = sequences.shape
```
- **What**: Extracts batch size (B) and sequence length (T) 
- **Why**: These dimensions drive all subsequent tensor operations
- **Critical Detail**: `sequences` contains character indices (0-64 for 65-char vocabulary), not raw text

**Line 1329: Boundary Detection**
```python
is_boundary = self.boundary_mask[sequences]
```
- **What**: Uses advanced indexing to mark boundary characters (spaces, punctuation) in each sequence
- **Why GPU-Optimized**: `self.boundary_mask` is a pre-computed boolean tensor of size `[vocab_size]` where `boundary_mask[char_idx] = True` for boundary characters
- **Performance**: Single GPU operation replaces potentially thousands of character comparisons
- **Critical Detail**: This leverages PyTorch's advanced indexing - `sequences` has shape `[B, T]` containing indices, result has same shape but boolean values

**Line 1330: Force Start Boundary**
```python
is_boundary[:, 0] = True
```
- **What**: Marks the first character of each sequence as a word boundary
- **Why**: Essential for word detection algorithm - ensures we can detect the first word even if it doesn't start with punctuation
- **Edge Case Handling**: Without this, sequences starting with letters would miss their first word

**Lines 1331-1332: Force End Boundary**
```python
if T > 1:
    is_boundary[:, -1] = True
```
- **What**: Marks the last character as a boundary for sequences longer than 1
- **Why**: Ensures the final word gets properly detected
- **Edge Case**: The `T > 1` check prevents issues with single-character sequences
- **Critical Detail**: This creates artificial word boundaries that may not exist in the original text, but are necessary for consistent word counting

**Line 1333: Buffer Initialization**
```python
word_counts = self.word_count_buffer[:B, :].zero_()
```
- **What**: Reuses pre-allocated tensor buffer for word length counts
- **Performance Optimization**: `word_count_buffer` is shape `[256, 5]` pre-allocated during class initialization, avoiding memory allocation in the training loop
- **Why 5 columns**: Tracks word lengths 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (length-2 indexing used later)
- **Memory Efficiency**: `.zero_()` is in-place, no new tensor allocation
- **Critical Detail**: Only uses first `B` rows for current batch size, but buffer supports up to 256 sequences

**Line 1334: Batch Loop**
```python
for b in range(B):
```
- **What**: Iterates through each sequence in the batch
- **Performance Trade-off**: This CPU loop is necessary because word boundary detection requires variable-length operations that don't vectorize well across the batch dimension
- **Why not fully vectorized**: Each sequence may have different numbers of words and boundaries

**Line 1335: Boundary Location**
```python
boundaries = torch.where(is_boundary[b])[0]
```
- **What**: Finds positions of all boundary characters in sequence `b`
- **Technical Detail**: `torch.where()` returns tuple of indices; `[0]` extracts the 1D position array
- **Result**: 1D tensor of character positions that are word boundaries

**Lines 1336-1337: Word Length Calculation**
```python
if len(boundaries) > 1:
    word_lengths = boundaries[1:] - boundaries[:-1]
```
- **What**: Calculates length of each word by subtracting consecutive boundary positions
- **Algorithm**: `boundaries[1:] - boundaries[:-1]` gives differences between adjacent elements
- **Edge Case**: Requires at least 2 boundaries to form 1 word
- **Example**: If boundaries are `[0, 3, 7, 10]`, word lengths are `[3, 4, 3]`

**Lines 1338-1339: Length Counting**
```python
for length in range(2, 7):
    word_counts[b, length-2] = (word_lengths == length).sum()
```
- **What**: Counts words of each length (2-6 characters) and stores in the buffer
- **Indexing**: `length-2` maps length 2→index 0, length 3→index 1, etc.
- **Why range(2,7)**: Curriculum learning focuses on 2-6 letter words as meaningful units
- **GPU Operation**: `(word_lengths == length).sum()` is a fast GPU reduction
- **Critical Detail**: Words of length 1 or 7+ are ignored - this is a design choice for the curriculum learning system

**Line 1340: Return Results**
```python
return word_counts
```
- **What**: Returns `[B, 5]` tensor with word length counts per sequence
- **Usage**: These counts feed into curriculum reward calculations that encourage proper word formation

### **Critical Details You Might Miss**

1. **Memory Efficiency**: The `word_count_buffer` pre-allocation eliminates GPU memory allocation during training, crucial for performance

2. **Artificial Boundaries**: The forced start/end boundaries mean the algorithm counts "words" that may not be real words in the original text

3. **GPU/CPU Hybrid**: While mostly GPU-optimized, the batch loop is necessary due to variable-length word detection

4. **Curriculum Integration**: This isn't just word counting - it's specifically designed to support later curriculum stages that reward 2-6 letter word formation

5. **Character-Level Processing**: This operates on character indices, not tokens, which is why it needs the `boundary_mask` lookup table

6. **Performance vs Accuracy Trade-off**: The simplified boundary detection (just punctuation/spaces) may miss complex word boundaries but is much faster than NLP tokenization

This function exemplifies the sophisticated optimizations needed for GPU-accelerated RL training where every operation in the training loop must be carefully optimized.
